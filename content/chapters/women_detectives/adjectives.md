# 🎯 Adjectives 

---

## 🧱 1. What is an Adjective?

An **adjective** is a word that describes a **noun** or a **pronoun**.  
It gives information about *what something is like*.  
In linguistic terms, an adjective *modifies* a noun.  

**Examples**:  
- A **beautiful** painting  
- An **ugly** one  
- The **old** house

## 🧭 2. Where Do Adjectives Go?

Adjectives usually come:

- **Before a noun**  
_a **scary** dog_  
- **After linking verbs** (like *be*, *seem*, *feel*, *become*), as subject complements _(attribut du sujet)_.       
_I feel **cold**._  
_She became **famous**._  
_You are **amazing**._

## 🚦 3. Order of Adjectives

When we use **more than one adjective** before a noun, we usually follow this order:

**👉 Size → Age → Colour → Origin → Material**


  **Examples**:  
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a **tiny brown cotton teddy-bear** (size, colour, material).   
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a **big brand-new yellow car** (size, age, colour). 






A more comprehensive theory may include these categories:

**👉 Opinion → Size → Age → Shape → Colour → Origin → Material**

**Examples**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I carried a very **small black** suitcase (size, colour).    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have some **old French** paintings (age, origin).   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was wearing a **new red silk** dress (age, colour, material).    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is a really **ugly wooden** chair (opinion, material).    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are some **new Chinese** students in the class (age, origin).    

> 💡 *Opinion is **subjective**, and material is more **objective**.*

## 💡 4. Adjectives Do Not Change

Unlike other languages (like French or Spanish), English adjectives:

- ❌ Do **not** change for **gender** → _a **brave** man / a **brave** woman_  
- ❌ Do **not** change for **number** → _a **red** apple / two **red** apples_


## 🧠 5. Quick Practice

**Put the adjectives in the correct order**:
1. A ___ ___ ___ ___ hat (green / old / funny / small)
      <details style="margin-bottom: 20px"> <summary>Show Answer</summary> A funny small old green hat </details>

2. A ___ ___ ___ ___ vase
(glass / beautiful / French / round)

      <details style="margin-bottom: 20px"> <summary>Show Answer</summary>A beautiful round French glass vase </details>
3. Two ___ ___ ___ chairs
(metal / uncomfortable / large)

      <details style="margin-bottom: 20px"> <summary>Show Answer</summary>Two uncomfortable large metal chairs <details>
4. A ___ ___ ___ ___ car
(American / black / fast / new)

      <details style="margin-bottom: 20px"> <summary>Show Answer</summary> A fast new black American car </details>
5. A ___ ___ ___ ___ bag
(leather / small / stylish / Italian)

      <details style="margin-bottom: 20px"> <summary>Show Answer</summary> A stylish small Italian leather bag </details>
